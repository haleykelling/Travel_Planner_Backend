Comment.create(text: 'We just got back from visiting the town square in Jackson. It took us about 8 hours to drive today and then we checked into the hotel and went downtown to walk around and have dinner. It is so crazy beautiful here. The mountains are so different from our mountains back home. I am so happy we made this trip happen! Our dinner tonight was delicious. Christopher claims it was the best steak he has ever had but I have heard that before.I am so excited for tommorow!', day: day1yellowstone)
Comment.create(text: 'So we just finished eating at Persephone Bakery, and it was AMAZING. I ordered the french toast and Christopher had the breakfast burrito, both of which were delicious. It was a super cute restaurant right outside of town. Now we are on our way to Old Faithful! ', day: day2yellowstone)
Comment.create(text: 'Right as we were parking Old Faithful erupted - what bad timing! So we waited another hour or so until it happened again. We walked around and looked at the gift shop and made it back in time to grab a seat. It gets crazy busy there! The eruption lasted about 4 minutes (of course Christopher timed it), which is on the longer side so that was pretty cool. Definitely worth seeing.', day: day2yellowstone)
Comment.create(text: 'On our drive up to the Grand Prismatic Springs, we saw a black bear!! It was a mom and two babies and they ran right across the road in front of us. Good thing I was paying attention and we stopped in time. We watched them run off into a wooded area right next to the car. Super cool!', day: day2yellowstone)
Comment.create(text: 'Our last stop today was at the Grand Prismatic Springs and let me tell you, it was beautiful. The spring was neon orange in places due to some sort of microbiota that makes it glow. We saw a couple other hot springs and pools as well. It was super windy and Christopher and I took a couple funny pictures. Overall, today was a super great day! I am excited for tomorrow!', day: day2yellowstone)
Comment.create(text: 'Wow I can not get over the views waking up here. We can see the Tetons from our hotel room and it is such a beautiful view! We are going on a long hike today so I will check back in tonight.', day: day3yellowstone)
Comment.create(text: 'Okay I am actually dying because we went on the longest hike ever today (15 miles!!) but it was so worth it when we got the lake at the top. I took so many incredible pictures of the waterfall along the way and all of the views. Definitely worth waking up early but I am ready for bed at 6:00! I am sad we are already leaving tomorrow but it has been such a wonderful trip!', day: day3yellowstone)
